/**
 * Renderer for the tiled images of {@link Image} data objects
 *
 * Multi-channel image data provides one tiled image per channel, whose tiles
 * carry the channel's values rather than colors. Each channel is recolored by a
 * data transfer (see {@link OpenSeadragonContext.updateTiledImageDataTransfer})
 * that scales the values between the channel's contrast limits and multiplies
 * them with the channel's color. Color and contrast limits are resolved by
 * {@link ImageUtils.getChannelColor} and
 * {@link ImageUtils.getChannelContrastLimits}; channels without contrast
 * limits are stretched over the value range of each tile's data type. In the
 * grayscale view mode, every channel is colorized white instead of its color.
 * Channels whose data does not provide values are drawn as they are, as is
 * image data that is not multi-channel. Channel visibility and opacity are not
 * part of the transfer: like layer and image opacity, OpenSeadragon applies
 * them when drawing the tiled image, which is also where the single-channel
 * view modes hide all but the image's active channel (see
 * {@link getTiledImageOpacity}).
 *
 * Channel colors, contrast limits and the view mode need no synchronization:
 * like visibility and opacity, they are read from the current model whenever
 * the image's tiled images are updated (see
 * {@link resolveTiledImageDataTransfer}), so changing them only requires
 * {@link setModel}. As data transfers are compared by identity, each channel's
 * data transfer is kept until the image's data, or the channel's resolved color
 * (white in grayscale) or contrast limits change, so that tiles are only
 * recolored when needed.
