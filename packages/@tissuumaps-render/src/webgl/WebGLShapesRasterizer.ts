 * Rasterizes shapes into the scanline data consumed by the shapes shaders

 * holes are cut out whatever the orientation of their rings. To keep that
 * affordable, the object's bounding box is divided into horizontal scanlines,
 * each of which holds only the shapes and edges that reach into it, and each
 * scanline into x-bins, each of which lists only the shapes that reach into
 * it: {@link rasterizeScanlines} rasterizes them straight into the layout the
 * GPU expects.
 *

   * testing edges, are distributed by area: a few large, detailed shapes among
   * many small ones cover most fragments when zoomed in. Shapes without edges
   * are left out, and if none of the others has an area, the median is

   *
   * Divides `objectBounds` into `numScanlines` horizontal scanlines, and
   * assigns each shape to the scanlines spanned by the bounding box of its
   * polygon shells, and each edge to the scanlines spanned by its own bounding
   * box, both padded by `scanlinePadding` above and below. Both are
   * conservative: a shape or edge may be assigned to scanlines it does not
   * actually reach into, but never to too few. Per scanline, it also lists the
   * shapes per x-bin, i.e. per column of `numBins` equally wide columns,
   * assigning each shape to the bins spanned by its x-range on that scanline,
   * padded by `binPadding` to the left and right. The paddings let the strokes
   * the fragment shader draws around a shape, which reach beyond it, find the
   * shape from the neighboring scanlines and bins as well (see
   * `WebGLShapesRenderOptions.shapePadding`). As shapes are
   * assigned in order, every bin lists its shapes in ascending order, which is
   * the order the fragment shader composites them in.
   *
   * Shapes are identified by their index among the *included* shapes, i.e.
   * `shapesMask` compacts the indices. Holes contribute their edges, but not
   * their bounds, as a shape is bounded by the shells of its polygons only.
   * Accordingly, the edges of a hole that reaches beyond the scanlines of the
   * shape's shells up to and including its own polygon, which is invalid
   * geometry, are dropped in those scanlines.
   *
   * Values are grouped into texels of four 32-bit values, in three sections:
   * the bin table, the bins' shape refs, and the scanlines' shapes and edges.
   * The shapes fragment shader documents the layout, and is the authority on
   * it.
   *
   * The shapes are rasterized twice, without keeping any per-shape data in
   * between: the first pass only counts the shapes and edges on every
   * scanline and the shapes in every bin, which determines where everything
   * goes, and the second pass writes the shapes, their edges and the bins'
   * shape refs right there. Apart from the buffer itself, this only
   * takes a few counters per scanline and one per bin.
   *
   * Yields between shapes, i.e. long-running rasterizations neither block the
   * event loop nor ignore an abort for long.

   * @param numScanlines - Number of horizontal scanlines
